# Practical-JS
Course from Watch and Code - Practical JavaScript  by Gordon Zhu. Completed to demonstrate an understanding of VanillaJS.

###Practical JavaScript from Watch and Code

I completed the [Practical JavaScript | Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript), by Gordon Zhu, course in 2018 and it consisted of putting together a to-do list with Vanilla JS. As you put together the project you learn all the elements you need to know as well as applying that knowledge in a practical way.
